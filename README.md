# MagiSH

A cross-platform Rust utility to locate and run Bash scripts with a user-friendly interface.

## Features
- Detects OS and ensures Bash (or WSL2 on Windows) is available.
- Shows the current working folder and all `.sh` scripts in it.
- Allows changing the working folder with `-c <folder>`.
- Lets you select or auto-detect a Bash script to run.
- Executes each non-comment, non-empty line of the script in Bash (or WSL on Windows) in the selected folder.

## üìù Usage

### Running MagiSH (after installation)
- On Linux, run:
  ```sh

  ```
- On Windows, use the desktop shortcut or run `magish.exe` from `Program Files\MagiSH`.

### How to Use
- On start, the program displays the current folder and lists all `.sh` files.
- To change the folder, enter:
  ```
  -c /path/to/your/folder
  ```
- To run a script, enter its filename (as shown in the list), or press Enter to auto-detect (it will pick the first `.sh` file found).
