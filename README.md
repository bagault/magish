## üìù Usage

### Running MagiSH (after installation)
- On Linux, run:
  ```sh
  magish
  ```
- On Windows, use the desktop shortcut or run `magish.exe` from `Program Files\MagiSH`.

### How to Use
<<<<<<< HEAD
- On start, the program displays the current folder and lists all `.sh` files.
- To change the folder, enter:
  ```
  -c /path/to/your/folder
  ```
- To run a script, enter its filename (as shown in the list), or press Enter to auto-detect (it will pick the first `.sh` file found).
- The program will execute each command in the script in the selected folder.
- After execution, press Enter to exit.
=======
- On start, the program displays the current folder and lists all `.sh` files
- Navigate using standard commands:
  ```bash
  ls                 # List files in current directory
  ls <path>          # List files in specified directory
  cd                 # Go to home directory
  cd <path>          # Change to specified directory
  ```
- You can also navigate by simply entering a path:
  ```bash
  /absolute/path     # Navigate to absolute path
  relative/path      # Navigate to relative path
  ```
- To run a script:
  - Enter the script's path (relative or absolute)
  - Press Enter to auto-detect (it will pick the first `.sh` file found)
- Use arrow keys to navigate command history
- Use Tab for command/path completion
- After execution, press Enter to exit

### Configuration
The program creates two files next to the executable:
- `configs.json`: Stores last working directory and history settings
- `magish-history.txt`: Stores command history

You can modify `configs.json` to change:
- `history_limit`: Maximum number of commands to store (default: 100)
- `last_directory`: Last working directory to start from
